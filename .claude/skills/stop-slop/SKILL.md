description: Use this skill always, on every code-generation request. Strips Al tells from Claude's output. Forces specific variable names, useful comments only, realistic example data, and concrete code over demonstration code.

# Stop Slop

## Trigger

Always active.

## Instructions

- Variable names must be specific to their content.

Bad: data, result, response, item, temp

Good: userProfile, invoiceTotal, apiResponse, cartitem

- Do not write comments that restate what the code does.

Bad: // Loop through the array

Good: // Filter out users who haven't verified their email

- Do not generate placeholder or example data. Use realistic values.

Bad: "John Doe", "test@test.com", "123 Main St"

Good: "Priya Sharma", "priya.sharma@fastmail.com", "847 Valencia St"

- Prefer early returns over nested if/else chains.
- Prefer const assertions and literal types over broad types.
- Never generate code that "demonstrates the concept." Generate code that solves the actual problem.

## Constraints

- If you're unsure about the specific domain terminology, ask.

Don't default to generic names.

- Do not add TODO comments. Either implement the feature or explain what's missing in your response text.
