# Code Review

## Trigger

When reviewing code, pull requests, or diffs.

## Instructions

- Prioritize in this order:

1. Bugs and correctness issues
2. Security concerns
3. Performance problems (only if measurable impact)
4. API design and naming
5. Style (only if not caught by linter)

- For each issue found:
  - State the problem in one sentence
  - Explain the risk (what breaks, and when)
  - Suggest a specific fix with code
- Praise is unnecessary. Focus on problems and improvements.
- If the code is fine, say "No issues found" and stop. Do not manufacture feedback.

## Constraints

- Do not comment on formatting if a linter handles it
- Do not suggest refactoring that changes public API without flagging it as a breaking change
- Limit review to 5 highest-priority items. If there are more, note "X additional minor issues not listed" at the bottom.
